## Knapsack Decision Task used for fMRI task

The task is coded using Unity Game Engine with C#. 

Here, you will find the standard Unity project folder structure. The project can be used to build the task using Unity. The fully built task is not provided in this repository due to storage space concerns. 

Input/Output data folders are located in Assets/DATAinf. This folder has to be added manually to the game after building.

### Game controls:
- Every new block space bar has to be pressed before moving to the fixation point screen
- Fixation point screen is presented at the beginning of each block until a ’T’ (scanner trigger code) is received.
- Buttons for the left and right buttons are ‘b’ and ‘c’, respectively.

Note: 
The key screen differences with the task used for the previous behavioral study are:
- Bill luminance was changed, and
- Weights were changed from ‘kg’ to ‘g’.
